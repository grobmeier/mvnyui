=======================

== 1.2.1 ==
 * Doesn't crash anymore with an IndexOutOfBoundsException when a source file does not exist.
 * More accurate logging.

== 1.2 ==
 * Exclude/include patterns added, with the caveat that the developer must name their source files so their
   lexicographical order is correct for minifying.
 * Don't minify a file type if the list of files to process is empty.
 * Make JavaScript minify error messages clearer.
 * Make file extensions configurable (e.g. it's now possible to save a JavaScript file as *.jsp or *.php).
 * Compiled against JDK 1.5 instead of JDK 1.6.
